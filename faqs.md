# FAQs

Does my child need a diagnosis or referral for occupational therapy?
No diagnosis or referrals are required. Many children who are neurotypical can also benefit from occupational therapy.

What should I expect during occupational therapy sessions?
At the initial visit, I will spend time talking to you to learn more about you and your child’s strengths and areas of concerns. We will identify general goals for therapy. I will also spend time establishing rapport with your child, by following their lead on playing. Establishing a positive relationship is an important step in seeing success in therapy. As Canadian developmental psychologist Dr. Gordon Neufeld said, “You cannot teach the mind before you have the heart. Connect before you direct.”

Subsequent visits (for an hour session) will typically include 50 minutes of 1:1 time with your child, and about 10 minutes to debrief and talk to parents about progress and strategies. Some parents choose to be involved for the entire session, where others prefer to give their child space.

Is occupational therapy provided in person or is there a remote option?
Depending on your needs, therapy can be provided in person with your child, or parent coaching sessions can be provided in virtual consultations.

Do you accept insurance?
Direct billing to insurance is not currently available. Check to see if you have occupational therapy coverage under your health insurance or health spending account. If it is not a covered service, please consider advocating for occupational therapy to be included in your benefits plan, to support you and other families in the future.

If you have FSCD funding, you can submit invoices to FSCD for reimbursement. Learn more about FSCD here: https://www.alberta.ca/fscd
