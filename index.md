# Hi there!

I'm Erica, a Calgary-based child development expert dedicated to helping children thrive. Rooted in play-based, child-led therapy, I believe in fostering growth, confidence, and joy in every child.

My focuses are on **providing classroom, in-home, and community support via Program Unit Funding (PUF) and Family Services for Children with Disabilities (FSCD)**.
