# Registered occupational therapist providing in-home and community support to help you and your child thrive. Rooted in play-based, family-centred therapy, I strive to nurture the uniqueness and strengths of each child to work toward goals in collaboration with the family.

Whether your child has a diagnosis or is neurotypical, occupational therapy can help address concerns in the following areas:
- fine motor skills (using the small muscles of the hands to manipulate small items, or print and draw)
- executive function (task initiation and completion, attention, problem solving, impulse control)
- sensory processing (how your brain processes and interprets sensory information, and how that affects how you function in the world)
- emotional regulation (managing big feelings)
- activities of daily living (feeding, toileting, dressing)
- Movement and coordination (using both sides of the body effectively to balance, climb, crawl and play)
- Kindergarten readiness (regulation skills, pre-printing/printing skills, following routines and multi-step instructions, social skills, indepdendence with self-care)
