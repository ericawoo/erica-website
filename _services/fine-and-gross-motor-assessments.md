These assessments are used to evaluate a child’s grasps, hand-eye coordination skills, motor control, and gross motor skills. Challenges in these areas can often impact a child’s functional participation and effectiveness in school activities such as printing and crafts. It can also impact daily living activities including dressing, feeding, and toileting.

Assessment results are often used to provide additional information to Doctors, receive Program Unit Funding (PUF), or supports through Family Services for Children with Disabilities (FSCD).
