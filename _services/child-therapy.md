Each child is unique with a range of skills and needs. That is why individualized therapy is provided to best facilitate the growth of each child. Private one-on-one therapy services are provided in the home, community, or via telehealth/video conferencing. Child therapy sessions are meant to be fun, engaging, and play-based wherever possible.
