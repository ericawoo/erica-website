Sensory processing assessments provide a comprehensive picture of how a child interprets and responds to sensory input from the environment and the body. These assessments allow for comparisons between school and at home. Often times, sensory processing challenges can contribute to behaviours and poor attention to task. This information allows individualized strategies  to be implemented so the child can function optimally in his/her environments.
