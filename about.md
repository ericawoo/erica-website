Hi! I’m Erica Woo, a pediatric Occupational Therapist based in Calgary, AB. With over 13 years of experience working with children in schools and homes, I’ve seen firsthand the growing need for OT support beyond the school system. That’s why I’m passionate about partnering with families to bridge that gap—finding creative, strengths-based solutions that truly work for them. As a mom of two boys, I understand the challenges of parenting on a personal level and combine evidence-based knowledge with practical, real-world experience.

Play is a child’s most important occupation. Children develop physical, cognitive, social, and emotional skills through play. Using a play-based approach, I help kids thrive while making learning fun and meaningful! Contact me for a free consult to see how I can help your child reach their full potential!
