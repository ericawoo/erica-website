![Occupational Therapy Services](/images/about-erica.jpg)

My name is Erica Woo and I am a registered Occupational Therapist in Calgary, AB. I have been working in the field of pediatrics for over 11 years. I have worked with children with a range of abilities and diagnoses. My focus has been providing classroom, in-home, and community support via Program Unit Funding (PUF) and Family Services for Children with Disabilities (FSCD). I have additional training supporting picky feeders using the Sequential Oral Sensory Approach.

I provide play-based therapy, as play is the most important occupation for children. Through play, children can explore, problem solve, regulate, and develop skills important to activities of daily living. My practice is child and family centered. Regardless of diagnosis, I believe in focusing on the child’s strengths and interests to help them grow and reach their potential. Through education and collaboration, I support families, caregivers, and classroom staff to implement strategies independently.
